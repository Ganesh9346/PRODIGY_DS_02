Project Title:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Student Performance Dataset (Prodigy Infotech - Task 2) ðŸ“ˆ

Project Objective:
The main goal of this project is to conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a student performance dataset. This analysis aims to:

Understand the key factors influencing student academic performance.

Identify trends, patterns, and relationships within student demographics, parental information, educational background, and test scores.

Uncover insights that could help in improving educational strategies or identifying at-risk students.

Dataset Description:

Name/Topic of Dataset: Student Performance in Exams



Key Features/Columns

Number of Rows/Columns 

Key Analysis Steps Performed:
(Review your notebook and list the main sections/steps)

Data Loading and Initial Inspection: Loading the dataset and examining its shape, data types, and first few rows.

Handling Missing Values

Descriptive Statistics: Generating summary statistics for numerical scores and frequency counts for categorical attributes.

Univariate Analysis:

Distributions of math score, reading score, and writing score (histograms, box plots).

Counts and proportions of categorical features like gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, etc.

Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis:

Analyzing the impact of gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, and test preparation course on math, reading, and writing scores (e.g., using box plots, bar plots, or violin plots).

Correlations between different scores.

Outlier Detection 



Tools and Libraries Used:
